In these examples, many of the requirement below have already been met, so we recommend you understand and use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basics\n",
        " - Create the graph using Python and the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) package.\n",
        "- Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.\n",
        "- Insert the graph in your report after the first paragraph with a reference to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Appearance\n",
        "- Use a white background.\n",
        "- Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.\n",
        "- Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images, because an export to Microsoft Word will not include the image.\n",
        "\n",
        " Axes\n",
        " - Data with x and y values should be presented using an xy scatter plot.\n",
        " - Label all axes and include units.\n",
        " - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph, not inside the graph border.\n",
        " - If the x-axis is time, then make time zero the beginning of the test.\n",
        " - Eliminate ranges of the x and y axes that are not used or meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Representation\n",
        " - Use data symbols, not a line, to show discrete data points.\n",
        " - However, if there is so much data that the symbols overlap, it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Plots\n",
        " - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curve Fitting\n",
        " - If curve fitting is used, explain why and include the equation elsewhere in the report.\n",
        " - The model or theoretical curve should be a smooth curve without data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a graph created by example code in the [Data Analysis&#46;md](https://github.com/AguaClara/team_resources/blob/master/Example%20Code/Data%20Analysis.md) document referenced in the beginning of this section. **Note that the code is included and linked at the bottom of this report.
